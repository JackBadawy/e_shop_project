weel start with the home page,
to begin with i'll make a basic heading and then test getting data from firestore.

successfully reteive data from firestore database, i am thinking i will add favoriting feature by useing authentication then making a new firestore collection for each user that keeps track of favorited items

lets start styling product container and boxes.

will remove description from product box and have image at top then product name & price and maybe quantity in stock

will keep track of favourite using state that accessed favourited boolean in firestore db.

added individual product pages using useParams

at this point i just need to add a nav bar and add a cart.

design of website will be heavily inspired by jb-hi-fi's website design, im thinking primary calour pallet will be black, light-green, white.
